Title: [FREE] Australian Legal AI Built on 229k+ Real Legal Documents - Beta Feedback Wanted

G'day legal professionals,

I've built an AI tool specifically for Australian lawyers using the Open Australian Legal Corpus (229,122+ real Australian legal documents). Looking for honest feedback from practitioners.

**What it actually does:**
‚úÖ Searches 229k+ real Australian legal documents on-demand
‚úÖ Generates professional legal briefs and Statements of Claim
‚úÖ Understands Australian jurisdictions (NSW/VIC/QLD court formats)
‚úÖ Uses real legal precedents from the corpus
‚úÖ 100% Australian-focused (no US legal confusion)

**What it doesn't do (yet):**
‚ùå Replace legal expertise (obviously)
‚ùå Provide real-time case updates
‚ùå Integrate with existing legal software

**Built with:**
- Umar Butler's Open Australian Legal Corpus
- HuggingFace AI models for semantic search
- Vector similarity matching for precedent finding

**Try it:** [YOUR-URL]

**Honest feedback wanted on:**
1. Is the document quality actually useful?
2. Would you pay for this if it was polished?
3. What features would make it genuinely valuable?
4. Too many/too few features?

Not trying to replace lawyers - just want to build something actually useful for Australian legal practice.

Cheers!
