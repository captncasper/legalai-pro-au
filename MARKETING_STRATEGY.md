Title: [BETA] Free AI Tool for Australian Legal Document Generation - Seeking Lawyer Feedback

Hi everyone,

I'm developing an AI-powered tool specifically for Australian lawyers that generates professional legal documents. Currently in beta and completely FREE while we gather feedback.

What it does:
‚úÖ Generates complete Statements of Claim (NSW/VIC/QLD formatted)
‚úÖ Creates professional legal briefs and memorandums
‚úÖ Analyzes case law and suggests legal strategies
‚úÖ 100% Australian law focused (no US/UK confusion)

What makes it different:
- Built specifically for Australian jurisdiction
- Understands state-specific requirements
- Generates court-ready documents (not just templates)
- Uses real Australian case law for analysis

Try it here: [YOUR-URL]

I'd love feedback on:
1. Document quality and accuracy
2. Missing features you'd find useful
3. Integration with your current workflow

Happy to answer any questions or add features based on your needs!
```
