It was a conclusion reached against a background where the applicant had earlier litigated in the Federal Magistrates Court, this Court and the High Court, the correctness of the decision to refuse a protection visa and the attendant decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal handed down on 18 November 2003: see SZCCX & Anor v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2006] FMCA 509; SZCCX v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1006",
