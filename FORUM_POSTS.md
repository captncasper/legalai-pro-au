Title: [Tool] Built an AI for Australian legal documents - seeking lawyer feedback

G'day r/auslaw,

After seeing colleagues struggle with repetitive document drafting, I've built an AI tool specifically for Australian legal documents. It's currently free while in beta.

**What it does:**
- Generates Statements of Claim (with proper NSW/VIC/QLD formatting)
- Creates legal memorandums and briefs
- Suggests relevant case law and strategies
- All based on Australian law (no US/UK confusion!)

**Built with:** The Australian Legal Corpus on HuggingFace - special thanks to the corpus contributors for making Australian legal data accessible!

**Example:** Input "client injured at shopping centre" ‚Üí Full Statement of Claim with proper pleadings, particulars, and prayers for relief.

**Try it:** [YOUR-URL]

Not trying to replace lawyers - just help with the tedious first draft. Would really appreciate feedback on accuracy and what features would actually help your practice.

Cheers!

Title: Beta Testing: AI Assistant for Australian Legal Drafting

Hello Lawyers Weekly community,

I'm developing an AI tool designed specifically for Australian legal professionals and seeking feedback from experienced practitioners.

The tool assists with:
‚Ä¢ Statement of Claim generation (all states)
‚Ä¢ Legal memorandum drafting
‚Ä¢ Case analysis and strategy suggestions
‚Ä¢ Document review and enhancement

Key differentiators:
‚Ä¢ 100% Australian law focused
‚Ä¢ Understands state-specific requirements
‚Ä¢ Generates court-ready formatting
‚Ä¢ No subscription during beta period

I'm particularly interested in feedback on:
1. Accuracy of legal citations and formatting
2. Practical usefulness in daily practice
3. Missing features that would add value

Access the beta: [YOUR-URL]

Happy to answer questions or schedule demos for firms interested in providing detailed feedback.

Best regards,

üöÄ Calling Australian Legal Professionals - Beta Testers Needed

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on: an AI-powered legal document generator built specifically for Australian lawyers.

After conversations with solicitors frustrated by generic international tools, I've created something uniquely Australian:

‚úÖ Generates complete Statements of Claim (not just templates)
‚úÖ Understands NSW, VIC, QLD court requirements  
‚úÖ Suggests relevant Australian case law
‚úÖ Creates professional legal memorandums

Currently offering FREE access during our beta phase in exchange for your valuable feedback.

If you're a lawyer who:
‚Ä¢ Spends hours on repetitive drafting
‚Ä¢ Wants to focus more on strategy than paperwork
‚Ä¢ Is curious about practical AI applications in law

I'd love your input: [YOUR-URL]

Looking for lawyers to test and provide feedback. Takes 2 mins to try.

Anyone here in legal field willing to give it a go?

## Follow-up Engagement Templates

### When someone tries it:
"Thanks for giving it a go! What type of documents do you draft most often? Happy to prioritize those features."

### When someone reports an issue:
"Appreciate you spotting that! Fixed and deployed. The [specific issue] should now work correctly. Mind giving it another try?"

### When someone suggests a feature:
"Brilliant suggestion! Adding [feature] to the roadmap. Out of curiosity, how often would you use this in your practice?"

### When someone is skeptical:
"Fair point! It's definitely not trying to practice law - think of it more like a very smart template generator that understands Australian legal formatting. What would make you more comfortable with the concept?"
