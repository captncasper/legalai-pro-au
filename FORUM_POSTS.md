Title: [Tool] Built an AI for Australian legal documents - seeking lawyer feedback

G'day r/auslaw,

After seeing colleagues struggle with repetitive document drafting, I've built an AI tool specifically for Australian legal documents. It's currently free while in beta.

**What it does:**
- Generates Statements of Claim (with proper NSW/VIC/QLD formatting)
- Creates legal memorandums and briefs
- Suggests relevant case law and strategies
- All based on Australian law (no US/UK confusion!)

**Built with:** Umar Butler's Open Australian Legal Corpus (229k+ documents, sampled for efficiency) - special thanks for making Australian legal data accessible!

**Real test scenarios to try:**
1. **Employment**: "Employee dismissed for reporting safety violations"
2. **Contract**: "Building contractor abandoned project, kept deposit"
3. **Negligence**: "Elderly customer slipped on unmarked wet floor"
4. **Property**: "Neighbour's tree damaged fence during storm"

**Try it:** https://legalai-pro-au-production.up.railway.app/

**Honest feedback wanted:**
- Is the document quality actually useful for practice?
- Would you pay $39/month for this if polished?
- What features would make it genuinely valuable?
- Limitations: Currently samples corpus for memory efficiency

Not trying to replace legal expertise - just want to build something genuinely useful for Australian practice. Being honest about current limitations while building toward comprehensive solution.

Cheers!

Title: Beta Testing: AI Assistant for Australian Legal Drafting

Hello Lawyers Weekly community,

I'm developing an AI tool designed specifically for Australian legal professionals and seeking feedback from experienced practitioners.

The tool assists with:
‚Ä¢ Statement of Claim generation (all states)
‚Ä¢ Legal memorandum drafting
‚Ä¢ Case analysis and strategy suggestions
‚Ä¢ Document review and enhancement

Key differentiators:
‚Ä¢ 100% Australian law focused
‚Ä¢ Understands state-specific requirements
‚Ä¢ Generates court-ready formatting
‚Ä¢ No subscription during beta period

I'm particularly interested in feedback on:
1. Accuracy of legal citations and formatting
2. Practical usefulness in daily practice
3. Missing features that would add value

Access the beta: [YOUR-URL]

Happy to answer questions or schedule demos for firms interested in providing detailed feedback.

Best regards,
[Your name]

üöÄ Calling Australian Legal Professionals - Beta Testers Needed

After conversations with solicitors frustrated by generic international tools, I've created something uniquely Australian:

‚úÖ Generates complete Statements of Claim (not just templates)
‚úÖ Understands NSW, VIC, QLD court requirements  
‚úÖ Suggests relevant Australian case law
‚úÖ Creates professional legal memorandums

Currently offering FREE access during our beta phase in exchange for your valuable feedback.

If you're a lawyer who:
‚Ä¢ Spends hours on repetitive drafting
‚Ä¢ Wants to focus more on strategy than paperwork
‚Ä¢ Is curious about practical AI applications in law

I'd love your input: [YOUR-URL]

## Follow-up Engagement Templates

### When someone tries it:
"Thanks for giving it a go! What type of documents do you draft most often? Happy to prioritize those features."

### When someone reports an issue:
"Appreciate you spotting that! Fixed and deployed. The [specific issue] should now work correctly. Mind giving it another try?"

### When someone suggests a feature:
"Brilliant suggestion! Adding [feature] to the roadmap. Out of curiosity, how often would you use this in your practice?"

### When someone is skeptical:
"Fair point! It's definitely not trying to practice law - think of it more like a very smart template generator that understands Australian legal formatting. What would make you more comfortable with the concept?"
