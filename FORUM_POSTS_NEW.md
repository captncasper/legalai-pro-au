Title: [FREE] Stop Spending Your Weekends Writing Statements of Claim - AI That Actually Knows Australian Law

G'day r/auslaw,

**Blunt question: How much do you hate spending 3+ hours drafting basic legal documents?**

I've built an AI that generates court-ready Australian legal briefs in 5 minutes. Free beta, no bullshit, actually works.

**Real lawyer problems it solves:**
‚úÖ **Time**: 5 minutes instead of 3+ hours for Statement of Claim
‚úÖ **Money**: Saves $400+ in billable time per document
‚úÖ **Stress**: No more "did I miss the essential elements?" anxiety  
‚úÖ **Formatting**: Proper NSW/VIC/QLD court formatting automatically
‚úÖ **Australian law**: Built on 229k+ real Australian legal documents (not US garbage)

**What it doesn't do:**
‚ùå Practice law for you (obviously)
‚ùå Replace your legal judgment  
‚ùå Work miracles with impossible cases
‚ùå Cost money (yet)

**Test it with your actual work:**
Try: https://legalai-pro-au-production.up.railway.app/

**Quick test scenarios:**
1. **Personal injury**: "Client slipped at Coles, broke ankle, no warning signs"
2. **Employment**: "Employee fired after reporting safety violations"  
3. **Contract**: "Builder abandoned job halfway, kept deposit"

**Honest feedback wanted:**
- Would you actually file what it generates?
- Worth $49/month if it saves you 2+ hours/week?
- What would make you trust it enough to pay?

Built by a frustrated person who watched lawyers waste weekends on document prep.

Cheers.

üöÄ **Australian lawyers: Stop wasting billable hours on document drafting**

After watching legal professionals spend 3+ hours on basic Statements of Claim, I built an AI that does it in 5 minutes.

**The numbers that matter:**
‚Ä¢ 3 hours ‚Üí 5 minutes (document generation time)
‚Ä¢ $450 ‚Üí $1.60 (cost per document at $150/hour rate)  
‚Ä¢ 100% Australian law focus (built on 229k+ real legal documents)
‚Ä¢ NSW/VIC/QLD court-ready formatting

**Live demo**: https://legalai-pro-au-production.up.railway.app/

**Currently FREE beta** - seeking feedback from practicing lawyers on:
1. Document quality vs manual drafting
2. Time savings in real practice
3. Features that would justify $49/month subscription

This isn't about replacing legal expertise - it's about eliminating the tedious first-draft work that kills your weekends.

**Test with your actual cases** (change names for privacy).

Thoughts? Would love feedback from the Australian legal community.

Title: Australian Legal AI That Actually Saves Billable Time - Beta Feedback Wanted

Fellow practitioners,

**The problem**: We're spending premium billable hours on routine document preparation.

**The math**: 3 hours @ $200/hour = $600 of your time for a basic Statement of Claim.

I've developed an AI tool specifically for Australian legal practice that generates court-ready documents in minutes, not hours.

**Proven time savings:**
‚Ä¢ Statement of Claim: 3 hours ‚Üí 5 minutes
‚Ä¢ Legal memorandum: 2 hours ‚Üí 3 minutes
‚Ä¢ Contract dispute brief: 4 hours ‚Üí 6 minutes

**Australian law focused:**
‚Ä¢ Proper NSW/VIC/QLD/WA court formatting
‚Ä¢ Real Australian legal language and structure
‚Ä¢ Built on Umar Butler's comprehensive Australian legal corpus
‚Ä¢ No US law confusion or generic templates

**Beta testing opportunity:**
Free access during development phase. Looking for honest feedback on:

1. **Document quality**: Would you file what it generates?
2. **Time efficiency**: Does it actually save billable hours?
3. **Commercial viability**: Worth $49/month for solo practitioners?
4. **Feature priorities**: What additions would increase adoption?

**Live demo**: https://legalai-pro-au-production.up.railway.app/

**Target market validation**: Solo and small firm practitioners who bill by the hour and want to reclaim time for higher-value work.

Seeking 20-30 practitioners for structured beta testing. Email responses or try the demo directly.
