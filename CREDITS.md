## Important Note

The legal corpus data is **NOT** our work. We have integrated it into our AI system to provide:
- Semantic search capabilities
- Legal document analysis
- Case law references

All credit for the corpus compilation and curation goes to the original authors.

## How We Use the Corpus

Our AI system:
1. Downloads the corpus from HuggingFace (when available)
2. Uses it for semantic similarity matching
3. References it for legal precedents
4. Enhances document generation accuracy

## Contributing Back

We believe in giving back to the community:
- Any improvements to corpus processing will be shared
- Feedback from lawyers using our tool helps improve the ecosystem
- We promote the corpus in all our marketing materials

## License Compliance

We respect and comply with all licensing terms of the Australian Legal Corpus and ensure proper attribution in:
- Generated documents
- Marketing materials  
- User interfaces
- API responses
