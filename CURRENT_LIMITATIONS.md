# ⚠️ Current System Limitations

## Memory Optimization Trade-offs

Due to Railway deployment memory constraints, the current system has been optimized for efficiency over comprehensiveness:

### Search Limitations:
- **50 documents maximum** per search (vs full 229k+ corpus)
- **Streaming approach** - samples corpus rather than full analysis
- **No vector embeddings** - keyword matching only for memory efficiency
- **Limited text snippets** - 300 characters vs full document content

### What This Means:
❌ **Not "1000+ Australian cases analyzed"** - currently samples ~50 documents  
❌ **Not comprehensive case law search** - limited by memory constraints  
❌ **Not full semantic search** - basic keyword matching  
❌ **Not complete precedent analysis** - samples only  

### What Still Works:
✅ **Professional document generation** using real legal knowledge  
✅ **Australian jurisdiction awareness** and proper formatting  
✅ **Access to real Australian legal corpus** (sampled)  
✅ **Court-ready document structure** and legal language  
✅ **Honest pricing** and transparent limitations  

## Path Forward

### Short Term (Current):
- Memory-optimized deployment on Railway
- Honest marketing about current capabilities
- Focus on document generation quality
- Gather user feedback on core functionality

### Medium Term (3-6 months):
- Upgrade to higher memory hosting for full corpus search
- Implement proper vector search over complete dataset
- Add comprehensive case law citation system
- Expand search to full 229k+ documents

### Long Term (6-12 months):
- Real-time legal database integration
- Professional citation formatting
- Practice management features
- Enterprise deployment options

## User Expectations

**What to expect NOW:**
- High-quality legal document drafts
- Australian legal structure and language
- Professional formatting for NSW/VIC/QLD courts
- Transparent about limitations

**What NOT to expect:**
- Comprehensive case law research
- Exhaustive precedent analysis
- Real-time legal updates
- Perfect accuracy without review

## Why This Approach?

1. **Honest marketing** - better than overpromising
2. **Real user feedback** - on actual current capabilities
3. **Iterative improvement** - build based on user needs
4. **Sustainable development** - within budget constraints
5. **Trust building** - lawyers value honesty over hype

**Bottom Line**: We're building something genuinely useful for Australian lawyers, being honest about current limitations, and planning systematic improvements based on real user needs.
