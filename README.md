# ⚖️ Australian Legal AI
## *The First AI That Actually Knows Australian Law*

**Stop wasting 3+ hours drafting basic legal documents. Get court-ready Australian legal briefs in 5 minutes.**

*Free beta for Australian lawyers - no credit card, no bullshit.*

## 💰 **What Lawyers Actually Get**

### Instead of spending your Saturday writing:
❌ **3 hours** drafting a Statement of Claim  
❌ **$450** in billable time lost to document prep  
❌ **Stress** about correct NSW/VIC/QLD formatting  
❌ **Risk** of missing essential legal elements  

### You get:
✅ **5 minutes** to generate professional draft  
✅ **$400+ saved** per document in time  
✅ **Court-ready formatting** for all Australian jurisdictions  
✅ **Built-in legal elements** (duty, breach, causation, damages)  
✅ **Real Australian legal language** (not US template garbage)  

## 🏛️ Built With Real Australian Legal Data

Powered by **Umar Butler's Open Australian Legal Corpus**:
- 229,122+ Australian legal documents
- Statutes, regulations, and case law
- Commonwealth, NSW, QLD, WA, SA, TAS, and Norfolk Island
- [View the corpus](https://huggingface.co/datasets/umarbutler/open-australian-legal-corpus)

## 🧪 **Try It Right Now (5 Minutes)**

**Live Demo**: https://legalai-pro-au-production.up.railway.app/

### Real lawyer test (do this now):
1. **Pick your worst document type** (the one you hate drafting)
2. **Enter a real case** you're working on (change names)
3. **Hit generate** and see if you'd actually file it
4. **Compare the 5-minute AI draft** vs your usual 3-hour process

### **Specific test cases that prove it works:**
- **Personal injury**: Slip & fall at Woolworths → NSW District Court Statement of Claim
- **Employment**: Unfair dismissal whistleblower → Federal Circuit Court brief  
- **Contract**: Builder abandoned project → VIC Magistrates Court claim
- **Property**: Council planning breach → SA District Court injunction

## 📊 Current Capabilities vs Limitations

### ✅ What Works:
- Professional document generation
- Australian jurisdiction awareness
- Real legal corpus access (sampled for efficiency)
- Court-ready formatting
- AI-powered legal knowledge integration

### ❌ What's Missing (Yet):
- Comprehensive case law search (limited to samples for memory optimization)
- Real-time legal updates
- Integration with Westlaw/LexisNexis
- Lawyer verification system
- Full case law citations with precise references
- Practice management features

## 💰 **Pricing That Actually Makes Sense**

### **Current**: FREE beta (no catch, no credit card)

### **After beta** (when it's actually worth paying for):
- **Solo Lawyer**: $49/month (*saves $2000+ in time monthly*)
- **Small Firm (2-5 lawyers)**: $149/month (*saves $8000+ monthly*)  
- **Medium Firm (6+ lawyers)**: $299/month (*saves $15000+ monthly*)

### **Why lawyers will actually pay:**
- **ROI calculation**: Save 2 hours/week = $1600+ monthly at $400/hour
- **Pricing vs value**: $49 vs $1600 saved = 3200% ROI
- **Compare to competitors**: LexisNexis $500/month, Smokeball $169/month (both don't generate docs)
- **Cost per document**: $1.60 vs $450 of your time per Statement of Claim
